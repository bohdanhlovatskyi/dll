## Prerequisites
- C++20
- Gtest
### Compilation

```sh
./compile.sh -R 
# here -R will remove intermediate build directories, look at other options in the script

# or directly via cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```
### Installation
To run tests (in the test folder) (as an out of source build !) user should have gtest globally installed.

### Usage
Usage is shown in the main.cpp and also the test folder

### Important!
All the work tested only on MacOS via clang compiler for C++20
